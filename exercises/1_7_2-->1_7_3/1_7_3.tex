Exercise $1.7.3$\\

Show that if $M$ is elementary matrix of type 1, then $M^{-1}$ is the matrix that differs from $M$ only in that it has a -m instead of a m in the \textit{(i, j)} position. Notice that $M^{-1}$ is the elementary matrix associated with the elementary operation that subtracts m times the $j$th row to the $i$th row.
